Ð¡hecking the environment for suitability for growing plants
The coursework project presented in this report is a circuit that brings together various components including microcontrollers, interface development, background development and database management. This project is an opportunity to demonstrate my ability to design, implement and seamlessly connect these different elements into a functional and cohesive system.
- Hardware: The microcontroller system consists of a circuit that includes an ARDUINO UNO R3 and various sensors connected to it such as MPX4115, PH meter, RV2 and DHT22, which measure various environmental parameters such as pressure, pH, humidity and temperature. The microcontroller system collects sensor data and sends it to a database via a server system for storage and analysis
- Front-End (React): The front-end component of the web application is responsible for rendering the user interface, displaying real-time sensor data, and providing interactive controls to manage the environment layout. It communicates with the server side to retrieve data and update the user interface accordingly.
- Back-End (Node.js, Express): the server component handles the server logic of the web application. It receives requests from the interface, retrieves data from the database, and communicates with the microcontroller system. Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, together with the Express framework is used to build the functionality of the server side.
- Database: The database component stores and manages the sensor data collected by the microcontroller system. It provides a reliable and scalable solution for storing environmental data. MySQL, a popular relational database management system, is used for its efficient storage and search capabilities
